Java KeyWords:
A Java keyword is one of 50 reserved terms that have a special function and a set definition in the java programming language. 
The fact that the  terms are reserved means that they cannot be used as identifiers for any other program elements, including 
class, subclasses, variables, methods and objects.
The keywords const and goto are reserved, even though they are not currently used. 
true, false, and null might seem like keywords, but they are actually literals; you cannot use them as identifiers in your programs.
